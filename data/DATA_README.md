The test data is provided in a ZIP format.

The V-FLUTE subset as used for training (in the same order as was used for the script and with the same id field) as well as the eViL subset are available via [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/11114281)
Some V-FLUTE instances were also incorrectly labeled as simile in the dataset on Zenodo (does not affect fine-tuning or results).

To obtain eViL data (e-SNLI-VE), follow instructions in their repo:
