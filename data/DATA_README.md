The images for the V-FLUTE subset exactly as used for training (with IDs corresponding to the ones in the data in this repo) as well as the images for the eViL subset are available via [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/11114281)

Some V-FLUTE instances were also incorrectly labeled as simile in the dataset on Zenodo (does not affect fine-tuning or results).
