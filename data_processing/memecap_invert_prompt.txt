1. Claim: A useful feature has been removed on YouTube, causing disappointment.
Explanation: The image shows a painting of a character with a distraught face and a speech bubble that reads "y tho," placed over text saying "When YouTube removed sort by oldest option." This implies that the removal of the sort by oldest option is a decision that users are questioning, hence indicating disappointment over the loss of a useful feature.
Opposite claim: An unhelpful feature has been removed on YouTube, causing happiness.

2. Claim: Hearing "All I Want for Christmas Is You" in the mall is becoming tiresome.
Explanation: The image depicts a text stating "All I Want for Christmas Is You Released 1994" above a picture of a character smiling with the caption "[visible happiness]". The image suggests that mall workers were visibly happy before 1994, implying that after the release of the song "All I Want for Christmas Is You," their experience changed, presumably due to the overplaying of the song in malls during the holiday season. This supports the claim that hearing the song in the mall repeatedly has become tiresome.
Opposite claim: Hearing "All I Want for Christmas Is You" in the mall is widely anticipated.

3. Claim: Feeling exhausted after only cleaning a room minimally.
Explanation: The image shows a text caption that reads, "Me: I should clean my room" followed by "Me after picking up one sock:", with the accompanying photo of a plush Kermit the Frog lying flat on its back, appearing exhausted on a bed. The image conveys the humor in feeling overwhelmed and tired after completing a very small and easy task, which is picking up just one sock, hence supporting the claim of feeling exhausted after only minimally cleaning a room.
Opposite claim: Feeling energized after only cleaning a room minimally.

4. Claim: Women often misconceive what kind of music a man is listening to.
Explanation: The image is a two-part meme. The top half shows two animated women looking at a man who is presumably listening to music on his headphones; one woman speculates that he might be listening to "probably heavy metal or hard rock." The bottom half reveals that the man is actually listening to the "Portal 2 Soundtrack," which is typically not heavy metal or hard rock, but more likely to be electronic or ambient music associated with the video game. This illustrates the claim that women often misconceive what kind of music a man is listening to, as the women's guess does not match the man's actual music choice.
Opposite claim: Women often understand what kind of music a man is listening to.

5. Claim: There is a humorous perspective about the relationship between time and money.
Explanation: The image shows two characters in armor resembling the Star Wars franchise's Mandalorian and Boba Fett. The top character says, "If time is money, then an ATM is a time machine." The humor comes from the play on the phrase "time is money," suggesting that if we equate time with money, withdrawing money from an ATM is likened to manipulating time, poking fun at the concept of a "time machine" from science fiction.
Opposite claim: ATM machine can act as a time machine.
